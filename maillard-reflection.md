* What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
I was defintely struggling with having a well oiled and funcitoning Git workflow. The pairing helped me to get a tighter grasp on the three stages of comitting, creating a pull request, and merging.
* What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
The pairing deifnitely clarified three stages of comitting, creating a pull request, and merging.
* What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
I asked my pair and the guide for prompts on commands, how Git tracks changes in each step of committing, and clarification on when/why we merge to the master.
* What still confuses you about Git?
I'm not sure if anything is entirely confusing at this point, but I definitely feel that I could practice this workflow more and really get it down to muscle memory.
* How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
I really enjoyed pairing! It really helped to clarify concepts that were covered in the previous week and gave a little bit of real life experience to working within a team.
