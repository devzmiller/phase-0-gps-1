* What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
I wasn't clear on the different phases of Git workflow between adding, committing, and pushing, and how they were different/how Git tracks changes in each phase.
* What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
The GPS clarified the differences between these phases, and also helped me get the whole workflow between Git and GitHub better situated in my head. It was also helpful for seeing the way you can navigate around branches and pull requests in GitHub.
* What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
I asked for reminders of commands, suggestions for commit messages, and about the Git workflow phases. 
* What still confuses you about Git?
I feel a lot more comfortable with it. I'm not sure how/where to look at the history of changes, but so far haven't made enough changes for that to be really necessary or useful.
* How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
Great! It was helpful to have someone to clarify commands and instructions with, and definitely felt like working on a team, which was great. Katy added some useful info on how Git workflow is commonly used in practice and she helped keep us on track.
